"Hello fellow hero, would you like some snacks, or perhaps some some gamepasses?"

User responds with Yes or no

If user responds with no "Oh ok, see ya later"

If user responds with yes "We have two gamepasses right now.
the fusion coil is a speed and gravity coil combined into one, it 
can help make your time going through all of this easier," 

The other gamepass is a gravity coil, it allows you to reach new heights, and if a part
struggles you, you can skip it.
